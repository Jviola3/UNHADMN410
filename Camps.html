				<p><b><font size=+4>Junior Camp (Ages 9-13)</font></b></p>
				<p>Our Junior Camp offers kids the opportunity to explore the game of basketball by being taught the basics of the game. In camp, our Juniors aren't just taught the tangible skills of basketball like how to shoot and play defense, we teach our kids about the rules of the game and run through real game scenarios in order to grow the basketball minds of the athletes. The main emphasis of this camp isn't so much to run games all the time, but to educate our kids on how to think basketball and how to develop their skills. Our Junior Camp trainer, <a href="staff.html">Lily Clifford</a>, is starting her first full year as the head trainer of the Junior Camp, and has a great basketball mind with her time spent playing basketball at Baylor University. Lily also spent all of last year learning how to train athletes under the wing of Senior Camp trainer, <a href="staff.html">Jeff Connors</a>, who also played 4 years of collegiate basketball at Boston College, where he was a part of the first BC team in 20 years to make it into the NCAA March Madness Tournament. Our Junior Camp begins on June 1,2021 and ends on August 17,2021. For parents interested in enrolling their kids into our Junior Program, you can <a href="regestration.html">register here</a>, or you can give our office a call at (321)-456-8970 and ask for <a href="staff.html">Pam Sweeny</a>.</p>

				<p><b><font size=+4>Senior Camp (Ages 14-17)</font></b></p>
				<p>In our Senior Camp, former Boston College star, <a href="staff.html">Jeff Connors</a>, challenges his athletes to to bring their games to the next level by running them through drills, conditioning excercises, and running 5v5 games. This high intensity camp starts June 1,2021 and runs through August 28,2021. Jeff gives a verbal gaurantee to all parents that he will turn their kids into stronger, more skilled, and smarter athletes. With his experience with college training, Jeff has a formula for his workouts that are meant to get the most out of every athlete without pushing them to the point of exhaustion. The Senior Camp also goes down to Connecticut from August 20th-22nd, to participate in the annual 'Youth Skills Challenge', where each program puts together multiple teams and competes in a tournament hosted by Boston Celtics Legend, Kevin Garnett. Our Senior Program has been recognized on 5 seperate occasions as a top 20 youth basketball progam in the country, and Jeff Connors looks to add another award to the program this summer.</p>
