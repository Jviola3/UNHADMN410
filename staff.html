Jeff finished off his senior year at Boston College with a 3.8 GPA, and played all four years on the university's Mens Basketball team. In his senior year, Jeff was a part of a team which made it to its first NCAA Tournament in over 20 years. Jeff went on to finish the year fourth in scoring on his team, and led the team in total assists.

				<li><b>Education: Baylor</b></li>
				<li><b>Experience: 4 Yrs</b></li>
				<li><b> Position: Junior Camp Trainer</b></li>
				</ul>
				<p>Lily started off her career at NextGen as an office assistant for the first two years of her tenure, and quickly discovered that she had a passion for working directly with kids. After Lily expressed this to our team, we immediatly started her off as an assistant to Jeff in the senior camp, where she got hands on training for the whole summer learning how build a strong program. As a result, Lily was promoted to Junior Camp Head Trainer at the end of the summer, and she will be enetering her first year as the lone trainer of the Junior Camp. Like Jeff, Lily also played collegiate basketball at Baylor for four years. Upon completion of her four years at Baylor, Lily decided that she wanted to use her finance degree and basketball experience, so she joined our team after she graduated. Lily has a great basketball mind, and is excited to get her first year started as a full-time trainer.</p>

				<p>When we interviewed Pam for the first time 5 years ago, we knew we had struck gold. Pam is an excellent worker with a glowing personality. Trying to finance something can be a stressful and anxiety inducing process, but with Pam's personality and knowledge the process is made much easier. Using her fiance degree from Yale University, Pam knows everything there is to know about financing options, and she will sit with each applicant and figure out the best financing method for that client,until they are completely satisfied.</p>
